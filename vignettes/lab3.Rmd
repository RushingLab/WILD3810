In this lab, you will learn about using population viability analysis (PVA) to predict the future dynamics of populations that are subject to stochastic variation in birth and death rates. 

***
**Objectives**

* Predict extiction risk using population viability analysis
  
* `R` functions used in this exercise:  
    + `library()`
***

## Setting up the exercise

1) Open RStudio

2) Click `File -> New Project`

```{r out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/new_file.png")
```
