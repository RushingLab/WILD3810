In the last homework assignment, you used an exponential growth model to predict the abundance of Eurasian collared-doves in Utah 20 years in the future. The model model predicted an *average* of 14,000 collared-doves at *each* BBS route, which is obviously way more doves than we expect to actually occur in Utah in 2035. At some point, resources will become limiting and population growth will slow.  

In this lab, we will use BBS data from other states where collared-doves were introduced earlier than in Utah to explore what happens to this species as populations grow beyond their initially small sizes.
