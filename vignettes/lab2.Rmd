In this lab, you will learn to model and predict the growth of plant and animal populations using `R`. Continuing from the first lab, we will continue learning how to use `R` to create and manipulate objects, with a particular focus on moving from vector objects to data frames. We will also learn about some basic plotting functions to visualize the dynamics of our study populations.
