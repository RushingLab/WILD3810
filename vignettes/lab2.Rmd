```

For this exercise, we will use data from the North American [Breeding Bird Survey](https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/) to model and visualize the rapid population growth of Eurasian collared-doves (*Streptopelia decaocto*) in the state of Utah. Eurasian collared-doves are an introduced species that, as you will soon see, have been rapidly expanding westward across the United States since they were introduced in Florida in the early 1990's.  

The Breeding Bird Survey is a roadside monitoring program conducted by volunteers across North America every year since the late 1960's. Each survey route is 25 miles long and surveyors stop every 0.5 mile (50 stops total) to count every bird they see or hear. For this lab, we will use the average number of counts in each year across all BBS routes that are located in Utah.

### Getting the data

A summary of the Utah collared-dove counts is included in the course package `WILD3810`. One thing we did not discuss in lab 1 was what packages are and how to access their content in your current `R` environment (remember that every time you open RStudio, it creates a new "environment". This environment stores all of the objects you create during that R session). Packages are ways to share custom `R` functions and data that do not come with `R` itself. Packages allow anyone to contribute useful code and data for other `R` users to use as part of their analyses. The `install.packages()` function downloads the package onto your computer (note that we use a slightly different function to install the `WILD3810` package but 99% of the time you will use `install.packages()`). 

It's important to realize that installing a package does not automatically make it's code and data available with your current `R` session. When you open `R`, you have to *load* the package in order to make its functions and data available in the current session. Packages are loaded using the `library()` function with the package name as the argument: 

```{r}
## Load the package to make data and code available in current R environment
library(WILD3810)
```

Now that we have loaded the `WILD3810` package, we can load the dove data using the `data()` function. This function is used to load data objects that come with packages:

```{r}
data("ut_dove_counts")
```

Notice that in the `Environment` tab in the top right panel, you now see an object called `ut_dove_counts`. This object holds the data values we will use in this exercise. 

## Introduction to data frames

In the [first lab](https://rushinglab.github.io/WILD3810/articles/lab1.html), we learned about one particular class of `R` object - vectors. Vectors hold a string of values as a single object. Although useful for many applications, vectors are limited in their ability to store multiple types of data (numeric and character).  

This is where data frames become useful. Perhaps the most common type data object you will use in `R` is the data frame. Data frames are tabular objects (rows and columns) similar in structure to spreadsheets (think Excel or GoogleSheets). In effect, data frames store multiple vectors - each column of the data frame is a vector. As such, each column can be a different class (numeric, character, etc.) but all values within a column must be the same class. Just as the first row of an Excel spreadsheet can be a list of column names, each column in a data frame has a name that (hopefully) provides information about what the values in that column represent.  

To see how data frames work, let's view the `ut_dove_counts` object. We can do this in several ways. The `head()` and `tail()` functions, for example, will print the first and last 6 rows of the data frame:

```{r}
head(ut_dove_counts)

tail(ut_dove_counts)
```

We can see that `ut_dove_counts` contains two columns: `Year` and `Count` (the counts are actually mean number of Eurasian-collared doves counted across all BBS routes within the state of Utah in each year). Obviously there weren't many collared-doves in Utah in the late 1960's/early 1970's. Several other useful functions for investigating the structure of data frames are `str()` and `summary()`

```{r}

str(ut_dove_counts)

summary(ut_dove_counts)
```

`str()` tells us about the structure of the data frame, in this case that `Year` is an integer object (only whole numbers) and `Count` is numeric. For both types of data, `summary()` provides some simple summary statistics for each variable. 

Another useful function is `nrow()`, which tells us now many rows are in the data frame (similar to `length()` for vectors):

```{r}
nrow(ut_dove_counts)
```

Because the `ut_dove_counts` data frame has one row per year, the `nrow()` function is very useful to determining how many years of BBS data we have (remember that!). 

### Subsetting data frames

As you will see shortly, one of the most common tasks when working with data frames is creating new objects from *parts* of the full data frame. This task involves subsetting the data frame - selecting specific rows and columns. There are **many** ways of subsetting data frames in `R`, too many to discuss so we will only learn about a few. 

#### Selecting columns

First, we may want to select a subset of all of the columns in a big data frame. Data frames are essentially tables, which means we can reference both rows and columns by their number: `data.frame[row#, column#]`. The row and column numbers have to put inside of square brackets following the name of the data frame object. The row number always comes first and the column number second. If you want to select all rows of a specific column, you just leave the `row#` blank. For example, if we wanted a vector containing all of the years the BBS data was collected:

```{r}
ut_dove_counts[,1]
```

However, an easier way of doing this is using `data.frame$column` (where `data.frame` is the name of the data frame object and `column` is the name of the column). For example,

```{r}
ut_dove_counts$Year
```

Notice that if you hit `tab` after you type the `$`, RStudio will bring up all of the columns and you can use the up or down buttons to find the one you want. 

Sometimes you may want to select more than one column. The easiest way to do that is to use the `select()` function in the `dplyr` package:

```{r}
library(dplyr)

select(.data = ut_dove_counts, Count, Year)

```

Notice that select requires us to first provide the data frame object (`.data = ut_dove_counts`) and then we provide the column names (unquoted!) we want to select. In this case we selected both columns but changed in the order. You can also use select to remove columns:

```{r}
select(.data = ut_dove_counts, -Year)
```

### Filtering rows

To select specific rows, we can use the `row#` method we learned above, this time leaving the columns blank:

```{r}
ut_dove_counts[1,]
```

If we want more than one row, we just put in a vector with all of the rows we want:

```{r}
ut_dove_counts[1:2,]

ut_dove_counts[c(1,30),]
```

Note that we can use the square brackets to also subset vectors, in which case we don't need the comma as long as you tell `R` which column you want first:

```{r}
ut_dove_counts$Count[1]
```

Sometimes, we may not know the specific row number(s) we want but we do know the value of one of the columns we want to keep. Using the `filter()` function in the `dplyr` package allows us to filter rows based on the value of one of the variables. For example, if we want just the 2004 count, we use:

```{r}
filter(ut_dove_counts, Year == 2004)
```

Notice the need for two equals signs (`==`) when telling `R` we want the row where `Year` equals 2. Filter makes it very easy to select multiple rows using operators like greater than, less than, etc. 

```{r}
filter(ut_dove_counts, Year > 2004)
```

or a more complicated example:

```{r}
filter(ut_dove_counts, Year < 1972 | Year > 2010)
```

## Visualizing data frames using `ggplot2`

`R` has very powerful graphing capabilities that make it possible to create data visualizations for reports or publications. As with most tasks in `R`, there are many ways to create graphs. For example, in the last lab we used the `hist()` function to create a histogram of the 1000 simulated estimates of $\hat{N}$. For the remainder of the course, we will focus on learning how to make figures using the `ggplot2` package. 

### Brief introduction to `ggplot2`

The power and flexibility of `ggplot2` come from it's consistent structure. Although a bit confusing at first, once you get the hang of it the structure actually makes it quite easy to create highly customized visualizations. All plots created using `ggplot2` use the same underlying structure:

$$\underbrace{ggplot}_{initiate\; plot}(\underbrace{data = df}_{data\;frame},\; \underbrace{aes(x =\; , y = \;)}_{plot\; attributes}) + \underbrace{geom\_line()}_{geometry}$$

The `ggplot()` function initiates a new plot. In this function, you tell `ggplot2` what data frame you will be using for the plot and you tell it how to map attributes of the data to the visual properties of the figures. Attributes are mapped inside the `aes()` argument. Attributes usually include location (`x-axis` and `y-axis` placement), color, size, shape, line type, and many others. In general, each attribute will be mapped to one column of your data frame. 

The `ggplot()` function simply initiates a graph - if you run just that portion of the code you will get a blank graph. We can see that by creating a new plot showing the relationship between `Year` (the x-axis of the plot) and `Count` (the y-axis): 

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = ut_dove_counts, aes(x = Year, y = Count))
```

You can see that `ggplot` created a figure with the correct axes and labels. But no data. That's because we didn't tell `ggplot` what type of *geometry* to use to represent the data. Geometry refers to the  type geometric object(s) we want to use to display the data. Common geometries include points (e.g., scatter plot), lines (e.g., time series), and bars (e.g., histograms). There are many others. Once we add a geometry, we can see the data:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = ut_dove_counts, aes(x = Year, y = Count)) + geom_point()
```

In this case, a line graph might make more sense:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = ut_dove_counts, aes(x = Year, y = Count)) + geom_line()
```

It's also possible to use more than one geometry:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = ut_dove_counts, aes(x = Year, y = Count)) + geom_line() + geom_point()
```

This is reasonable figure showing changes in collared-dove counts across time. But `ggplot2` makes it very easy to tweak the way the data is visualized (maybe too easy, you can spend *a lot* of time tweaking minor details). For example, maybe we want to scale the size of the points based on the size of the counts (so larger points are displayed using larger points). Because we want to map an *attribute* (size) to a variable (count), we make this change inside of `aes`:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = ut_dove_counts, aes(x = Year, y = Count, size = Count)) + geom_line() + geom_point()
```

That's not exactly what we wanted. Both the line width and the point size are now a function of `Count`. To make just the points a function of count, we specify `size = Count` inside of the `geom_point()` function (anything in the `ggplot()` function will apply to all geoms):

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = ut_dove_counts, aes(x = Year, y = Count)) + geom_line() + geom_point(aes(size = Count))
```

We can also do things like the change the color of the geometries. In this case, we are **not** mapping a variable to an attribute (color is not a function of the data values). So these changes happen **outside** of the `aes()` argument:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = ut_dove_counts, aes(x = Year, y = Count)) + geom_line(color = "grey50") + geom_point(color = "red")
```

One last example. My personal opinion is that points plotted over a line look a little better when there is a little white space between the line and the point. In `ggplot2` a hack to do that is to put white points *underneath* the red points that are slightly bigger than the red points. To this we add another `geom_point()` but manually change the size to be slightly bigger than the red points. Also note that `ggplot2` adds the geometries in the order that they are included in the code so we need to add the white points before the red points:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = ut_dove_counts, aes(x = Year, y = Count)) + geom_line(color = "grey50") + geom_point(color = "white", size = 4.5) + geom_point(color = "red", size = 3)
```

Notice that in this case, we aren't mapping size to any data so we include it outside of `aes()`.
