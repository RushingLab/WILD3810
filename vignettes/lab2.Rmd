In this lab, you will learn to model and predict the growth of plant and animal populations using `R`. Continuing from the first lab, we will continue learning how to use `R` to create and manipulate objects, with a particular focus on moving from vector objects to data frames. We will also learn about some basic plotting functions to visualize the dynamics of our study populations.

```

For this exercise, we will use data from the North American [Breeding Bird Survey](https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/) to examine the rapid population growth of Eurasian collared-doves (*Streptopelia decaocto*) in the state of Utah. Eurasian collared-doves are an introduced species that, as you will soon see, have been rapidly expanding westward across the United States. In this lab, we will focus on modeling and visualizing this growth.  

### Getting the data

A summary of the Utah collared-dove counts is included in the course package `WILD3810`. Because the data was added to the package after our last lab, we need to install the most update-to-date version of the package to access it.

```{r eval=FALSE}
## Re-install course website to get the most up-to-date version
devtools::install_github("RushingLab/WILD3810")
```

One thing we did not discuss in lab 1 was what packages are and how to access their content in your current `R` environment (remember that every time you open RStudio, it creates a new "environment". This environment stores all of the objects you create during that R session). Packages are ways to share custom `R` functions and data that do not come with `R` itself. Packages allow anyone to contribute useful code and data for other `R` users to use as part of their analyses. The `install.packages()` function downloads the package onto your computer. However, when we open `R`, we have *load* the package in order to make its functions and data available in our current session. Packages are loaded using the `library()` function with the package name as the argument: 

```{r}
## Load the package to make data and code available in current R environment
library(WILD3810)
```

Now that we have loaded the `WILD3810` package, we can load the dove data using the `data()` function:

```{r}
data("doves")
```

Notice that in the `Environment` tab in the top right panel, you now see an object called `doves`. This object holds the data values we will use in this exercise. 

## Introduction to data frames

In the [last lab](https://rushinglab.github.io/WILD3810/articles/lab1.html), we learned about one particular class of `R` object - vectors. Vectors hold a string of values as a single object. Although useful for many applications, vectors are limited in their ability to store multiple types of data (numeric and character).  

This is where data frames become useful Perhaps the most common type data object you will use in `R` is the data frame. Data frames are tabular objects (rows and columns) similar in structure to spreadsheets (think Excel or GoogleSheets). In effect, data frames store multiple vectors - each column of the data frame is a vector. As such, each column can be a different class (numeric, character, etc.) but all values within a column must be the same class. Just as the first row of an Excel spreadsheet can be a list of column names, each column in a data frame has a name that (hopefully) provides information about what the values in that column represent.  

To see how data frames work, let's view the `doves` object. We can do this in several ways. The `head()` function, for example, will print the first 6 rows of the data frame:

```{r}
head(doves)
```
We can see that `doves` contains two columns: `Year` and `Count` (the counts are actually mean number of Eurasian-collared doves counted across all BBS routes within the state of Utah in each year). Obviously there weren't many collared-doves in Utah in the late 1960's. Several other useful functions for investigating the structure of data frames are `str()` and `summary()`

```{r}

str(doves)

summary(doves)
```
`str()` tells us about the structure of the data frame, in this case that `Year` is an integer object (only whole numbers) and `Count` is numeric. For both types of data, `summary()` provides some simple summary statistics for each variable. 

Another useful function is `nrow()`, which tells us now many rows are in the data frame (similar to `length()` for vectors):

```{r}
nrow(doves)
```

### Subsetting data frames

As you will see shortly, one of the most common tasks when working with data frames is creating new objects from *parts* of the full data frame. This task involves subsetting the data frame - selecting specific rows and columns. There are **many** ways of subsetting data frames in `R`, too many to discuss so we will only learn about a few. 

#### Selecting columns

First, we may want to select a subset of all of the columns in a big data frame. Data frames are essentially tables, which means we can reference both rows and columns by their number: `data.frame[row#, column#]`. The row and column numbers have to put inside of square brackets following the name of the data frame object. The row number always comes first and the column number second. If you want to select all rows of a specific column, you just leave the `row#` blank:

```{r}
doves[,1]
```

However, an easier way of doing this is using `data.frame$column` (where `data.frame` is the name of the data frame object and `column` is the name of the column). For example,

```{r}
doves$Year
```

Notice that if you hit `tab` after you type the `$`, RStudio will bring up all of the columns and you can use the up or down buttons to find the one you want. 

Sometimes you may want to select more than one column. The easiest way to do that is to use the `select()` function in the `dplyr` package:

```{r}
library(dplyr)

select(.data = doves, Count, Year)

```

Notice that select requires us to first provide the data frame object (`.data = doves`) and then we provide the column names (unquoted!) we want to select. In this case we selected both columns but changed in the order. You can also use select to remove columns:

```{r}
select(.data = doves, -Year)
```

### Filtering rows

To select specific rows, we can use the `row#` method we learned above:

```{r}
doves[1,]
```

If we want more than one row, we just put in a vector with all of the rows we want:

```{r}
doves[1:2,]

doves[c(1,30),]
```

Note that we can use the square brackets to also subset vectors, in which case we don't need the comma:

```{r}
doves$Count[1]
```

Sometimes, we may not know the specific row number(s) we want but we do know the value of one of the columns we want to keep. Using the `filter()` function in the `dplyr` package allows us to filter rows based on the value of one of the variables. For example, if we want just the 2004 count, we use:

```{r}
filter(doves, Year == 2004)
```

Notice the need for two equals signs (`==`) when telling `R` we want the row where `Year` equals 2. Filter makes it very easy to select multiple rows using operators like greater than, less than, etc. 

```{r}
filter(doves, Year > 2004)
```

or a more complicated example:

```{r}
filter(doves, Year < 1972 | Year > 2010)
```

## Visualizing data frames using `ggplot2`

`R` has very powerful graphing capabilities that make it possible to create data visualizations for reports or publications. As with most tasks in `R`, there are many ways to create graphs. For example, in the last lab we used the `hist()` function to create a histogram of the 1000 simulated estimates of $\hat{N}$. For the remainder of the course, we will focus on learning how to make figures using the `ggplot2` package. 

### Brief introduction to `ggplot2`

The power and flexibility of `ggplot2` come from it's consistent structure. Although a bit confusing at first, once you get the hang of it the structure actually makes it quite easy to create highly customized visualizations. All plots created using `ggplot2` use the same underlying structure:

$$\underbrace{ggplot}_{initiate\; plot}(\underbrace{data = df}_{data\;frame},\; \underbrace{aes(x =\; , y = \;)}_{plot\; attributes}) + \underbrace{geom\_line()}_{geometry}$$

The `ggplot()` function initiates a new plot. In this function, you tell `ggplot2` what data frame you will be using for the plot and you tell it how to map attributes of the data to the visual properties of the figures. Attributes are mapped inside the `aes()` argument. Attributes usually include location (`x-axis` and `y-axis` placement), color, size, shape, line type, and many others. In general, each attribute will be mapped to one column of your data frame. 

The `ggplot()` function simply initiates a graph - if you run just that portion of the code you will get a blank graph. We can see that by creating a new plot showing the relationship between `Year` (the x-axis of the plot) and `Count` (the y-axis): 

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = doves, aes(x = Year, y = Count))
```

You can see that `ggplot` created a figure with the correct axes and labels. But no data. That's because we didn't tell `ggplot` what type of *geometry* to use to represent the data. Geometry refers to the  type geometric object(s) we want to use to display the data. Common geometries include points (e.g., scatter plot), lines (e.g., time series), and bars (e.g., histograms). There are many others. Once we add a geometry, we can see the data:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = doves, aes(x = Year, y = Count)) + geom_point()
```

In this case, a line graph might make more sense:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = doves, aes(x = Year, y = Count)) + geom_line()
```

It's also possible to use more than one geometry:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = doves, aes(x = Year, y = Count)) + geom_line() + geom_point()
```

This is reasonable figure showing changes in collared-dove counts across time. But `ggplot2` makes it very easy to tweak the way the data is visualized (maybe too easy, you can spend *a lot* of time tweaking minor details). For example, maybe we want to scale the size of the points based on the size of the counts (so larger points are displayed using larger points). Because we want to map an *attribute* (size) to a variable (count), we make this change inside of `aes`:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = doves, aes(x = Year, y = Count, size = Count)) + geom_line() + geom_point()
```

That's not exactly what we wanted. Both the line width and the point size are now a function of `Count`. To make just the points a function of count, we specify `size = Count` inside of the `geom_point()` function (anything in the `ggplot()` function will apply to all geoms):

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = doves, aes(x = Year, y = Count)) + geom_line() + geom_point(aes(size = Count))
```

We can also do things like the change the color of the geometries. In this case, we are **not** mapping a variable to an attribute (color is not a function of the data values). So these changes happen **outside** of the `aes()` argument:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = doves, aes(x = Year, y = Count)) + geom_line(color = "grey50") + geom_point(color = "red")
```

One last example. My personal opinion is that points plotted over a line look a little better when there is a little white space between the line and the point. In `ggplot2` a hack to do that is to put white points *underneath* the red points that are slightly bigger than the red points. To this we add another `geom_point()` but manually change the size to be slightly bigger than the red points. Also note that `ggplot2` adds the geometries in the order that they are included in the code so we need to add the white points before the red points:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = doves, aes(x = Year, y = Count)) + geom_line(color = "grey50") + geom_point(color = "white", size = 4.5) + geom_point(color = "red", size = 3)
```

Notice that in this case, we aren't mapping size to any data so we include it outside of `aes()`.

## Estimating $\large \lambda$

As the lead avian ecologist for DWR, we may want to know the population growth rate of the dove population so we can predict how big it might get in the future. Remember from lecture 3 that:

$$\Large \lambda = \bigg(\frac{N_{T}}{N_0}\bigg)^{\frac{1}{T}}$$

Let's use the dove counts to estimate $\lambda$ for this population. Remember that $T$ is the number of years over which we want to estimate growth. Since the `doves` data frame has one row for each year, we can easily estimate the total number of years using `nrow()`

```{r}
## Create object to store the number of years
## Note that `T` is reserved in `R` as shorthand for `TRUE` so we can't use that as the object name
## Also note that putting the entire line of code inside parentheses will both create and print the object
(t <- nrow(doves))
```

Now we can create objects with the first ($N_0$) and last ($N_T$) counts. Use code below and the subsetting rules we learned about earlier to create these objects:

```{r eval = FALSE}
N0 <- 
  
NT <- 
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
N0 <- doves$Count[1]
  
NT <- doves$Count[t]
  
```

Notice that because $N_0=0$, the formula for $\lambda$ will not return an estimate (can't divide by 0!). To get around this, we'll simply make that count 1. This will slightly change our estimate of $\lambda$ but not by enough to change our conclusions:

```{r}
N0 <- 1
```

Now we can estimate $\lambda$:

```{r}
(lambda <- (NT/N0)^(1/t))
```

So over the 48 years of the Breeding Bird Survey, Eurasian collared-doves increased by about 12% per year in Utah. 

But that's not really a very accurate reflection of the actual growth rate because for the first several decades, there were no doves at all. Once the doves arrived in Utah, their population growth was much more explosive. It is probably more instructive to estimate the rate of population growth for only the years when doves were counted in the state (`Count > 0`). To estimate this rate, let's first create a new data frame containing only the non-zero counts. **What arguments do you need to provide to `filter()` to create the data frame we want?**

```{r eval = FALSE}
doves2 <- filter()
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
doves2 <- filter(doves, Count > 0)
```

Now we'll recycle the code we created earlier to re-estimate $\lambda$:

```{r}
t <- nrow(doves2)

N0 <- doves2$Count[1]
  
NT <- doves2$Count[t]

(lambda <- (NT/N0)^(1/t))
```

A nearly 50% increase per year over the `r t` years since collared-doves were first documented in the state. 

## Predicting future population size

Your bosses at DWR want to know what the size of the collared-dove population will be over the next 20 years. Assuming they keep growing at a rate of `r lambda`, we can use the discrete population growth model to predict annual counts of collared-doves over this time period (for now, we'll ignore the fact that BBS counts are an **index** of abundance and not an **estimate**). Remember that:

$$N_{t+1} = N_t \times \lambda$$

So if we start with the average count in 2015 (the last year we have data for), we can simply use the $\lambda$ estimate to predict the count in 2016. Then we use the 2016 prediction to predict the 2017 count. And we continue until we reach the predicted 2035 count. 

### Creating an new data frame

The first step in our prediction is to create a new data frame that will contain the predicted counts in each year. Creating a new data frame is done using the `data.frame()` function. In this function, we provide the name of each column followed by a vector containing the values of that column. Just like naming vector objects, the column names cannot start with a number and should not contain spaces. 

```{r echo = TRUE}
## Create the new data frame 
predicted_doves <- data.frame(Year = seq(from = 2015, to = 2035), 
                              Count = NA)
```

We give this data frame the same column names as the original `doves` data frame. Unlike when creating objects (where we use the `<-` operator), you **must** use an equals sign to create each column in a data frame. To fill in the `Year` column, we use the `seq()` function which creates a sequence of values between the `from` and `to` values that are supplied as arguments:

```{r}
seq(from = 2015, to = 2035)
```

We start this sequence at 2015 since that's the last year we have counts for (and the first one we'll use to predict future counts). In the `Count` column, we simply gave it a value of `NA`, which in `R` is how you code "missing" data (in this case it's not missing, we just haven't created it yet). Essentially, this creates an empty vector that we will in next. Note that is we give a single value when creating the column, `R` will recycle that value for each element in the vector. 

The `Count` column is not totally unknown - we do know the count in 2015. We can fill in that value using the subsetting rules that we have already learned:

```{r}
## Fill in the 2015 count based on the value in the original data frame
predicted_doves$Count[1] <- doves$Count[nrow(doves)]
```

### Filling in the predicted counts

We are now ready to fill in the missing counts. Because the predicted count in each year is a function of the count in the previous year, we have to fill them in in order. We could do that by just typing out the population growth formula for each year:

```{r eval = FALSE}
## 2016 count
predicted_doves$Count[2] <- predicted_doves$Count[1] * lambda

## 2017 count
predicted_doves$Count[3] <- predicted_doves$Count[2] * lambda

## 2018 count
predicted_doves$Count[4] <- predicted_doves$Count[2] * lambda

```

But that is a lot of typing. Notice that in each line of code, we're doing *exactly* the same thing just with different values. `R` has many ways to apply a specific operation (in this case `count[t] <- count[t-1] * lambda`) multiple times without having to manually write out each separate line of code. One of the most basic ways of doing this is with `for` loops. 

`for` loops allow us to give `R` a chunk of code, run that code a set number of times, and each time the code is run change the values that need to be changed. In our case, we need to run `count[t] <- count[t-1] * lambda` 20 times (once for each year), each time changing the value of $t$ ($2, 3, 4, 5,...,20$). The following code does exactly that using a `for` loop:

```{r}
## Fill in predicted counts
for(t in seq(from = 2, to = nrow(predicted_doves))){
  predicted_doves$Count[t] <- predicted_doves$Count[t - 1] * lambda
}
```

Inside the `for()` function, we first provide the *index* that will change each time we loop through the code. In this case, we call the index `t` (though we could call it `i` or `j` or `year` or whatever we want). When we place this index symbol in the code, `R` will replace it with a number. Essentially, at the beginning of each loop `R` creates in objected called `t` and assigns it a specific value (e.g. `t <- 2`). 

After providing the index, we tell `R` what values we want the index to take by providing a sequence of numbers. In this case, we want to predict counts in rows 2-21 of our data frame so we provide a sequence from 2 to 21 (again using the `seq()` function). Note that instead of writing `21` we had `R` figure out how many rows were in the `predicted_doves` data frame and use that as the end of the sequences. Although no necessary, that makes the code more flexible because if the number of years change (we project to 2045 instead of 2035), the `for` loop will still run the entire sequences instead of just to 2035. 

The `in` between the index and the sequence is `R`'s way of saying `t` will take each value *in* the sequence 2-21. 

The `for(t in seq(from = 2, to = nrow(predicted_doves)))` sets up the parameters of the loop. After that line we enclose the code we want to run within each loop between curly brackets (`{}`). In this case, we just use the single line that fills in the predicted counts based on the previous year's count, making sure to include the index `t` in the appropriate places. 

***
**On your own**  

- Use the `head` function to double check that the first few counts look OK.  

- What is the predicted count in the year 2035?  

- We also learned that you can estimate $N_T$ as $N_0 \times \lambda^T$. Do the two methods provide the same predicted count?  

***

### Combining the data frames

Before we visualize the predicted counts, let's combine the newly create data frame with the original data so our figure shows the entire time series in one plot. First, we need to remove the first row of the `predicted_doves` data frame so we don't duplicate the 2015 count:

```{r}
predicted_doves <- filter(predicted_doves, Year > 2015)
```

Before we combine the data frames, let's add a new column to each one that tells us whether the counts are predictions or actual counts. The `dplyr` package has a useful function for adding columns to a data frame called `mutate()`. This function take the original data frame, the name of the new column and the values of the new variable as arguments:

```{r}
predicted_doves <- mutate(predicted_doves, Type = "Predicted")
doves <- mutate(doves, Type = "Count")
```

Here, we added a new column called `Type` to both data frames and gave a value of `Predicted` for the predicted counts and `Count` for the actual counts (remember that `R` will recycle the single value for each row of the data frame). Now we can combine the data frames using the `bind_rows` function from the `dplyr` package:

```{r}
all_doves <- bind_rows(doves, predicted_doves)
```

`bind_rows()` take two or more data frames as arguments and put them together as a single data frame by stacking them on atop the other (if the data frames do not have the same columns, `bind_rows` includes all columns in all data frames and fills in `NA` values for the missing values).

Now we can use the same plotting code to visualize the predicted counts. However, we'll modify it slightly by mapping the color of the points to the type of count (count vs. prediction)

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = all_doves, aes(x = Year, y = Count)) + geom_line(color = "grey50") + 
  geom_point(color = "white", size = 4.5) + geom_point(aes(color = Type), size = 3)
```

That's a lot of doves. This is why exponential population growth is so powerful from 0 to 466,225 in three decades. Also, notice that `gglot2` automatically added a legend showing us what color corresponds to which type of count. 

# Modeling density-dependent growth

An *average* of 466,225 collared-doves at *each* BBS route is obviously way more doves that we expect to actually occur in Utah in 2035. At some point, resources will become limiting and population growth will slow.  

In the next homework, we will use BBS data from other states where collared-doves were introduced earlier than in Utah to explore what happens to this species as populations grow beyond their initially small sizes. To create this homework:
