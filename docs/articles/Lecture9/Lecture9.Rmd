## Life tables

#### If detection probability is $<1$  

- $N_x$ will be biased low  

- All other life table statistics will be biased as well

    + Survival biased low, mortality biased high

## Survival estimation

#### Methods used to estimate plant and animal survival generally fall into three categories:  

1) Known fate  

2) Capture-mark-recapture  

3) Recovery models

## Known fate

#### Location and fate (alive or dead) of every marked individual is known at each sampling occasion

- $\LARGE P_{det} = 1$


--
#### What types of data can be used for known fate analyses?

## Known fate

#### Data

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
df <- data.frame(animal = c("Indv 1", "Indv 2", "Indv 3"),
                 ch = c("111", "110", "100"),
                 prb = c("\\(S_1 \\times S_2\\)", "\\(S_1 \\times (1-S_2)\\)", "\\(1-S_1\\)"))

names(df) <- c("Individual", "Capture history", "Probability")
df2 <- df
df2[,3] <- ""
df2 %>%
  kable("html", align = 'c', escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = TRUE) 
```

--

#### Individual 1

- Captured on occasion 1  

- Resighted alive on occasion 2  

- Resighted alive on occasion 3  

---
## Known fate

#### Data

```{r}
df3 <- df
df3[,3] <- c(as.character(df[1,3]), "", "")
df3 %>%
  kable("html", align = 'c', escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = TRUE) 
```


#### Individual 1

- Captured on occasion 1  

- Resighted **alive** on occasion 2  

- Resighted **alive** on occasion 3  

---
## Known fate

#### Data

```{r}
df3 %>%
  kable("html", align = 'c', escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = TRUE) 
```


#### Individual 2

- Captured on occasion 1  

- Resighted **alive** on occasion 2  

- Resighted **dead** on occasion 3  

---
## Known fate

#### Data

```{r}
df4 <- df
df4[,3] <- c(as.character(df[1,3]), as.character(df[2,3]), "")
df4 %>%
  kable("html", align = 'c', escape = FALSE) %>%

#### Individual 3

- Captured on occasion 1  

- Resighted **dead** on occasion 2  

- Known **dead** on occasion 3

## Known fate

#### Intuitively, 

$$\LARGE S_t = \frac{y_t}{n_t}$$

- $\Large y_t$: Number of individuals alive at the end of interval $\Large t$

- $\Large n_t$: Number of individuals at risk of dying during interval $\Large t$


--
### Who is at risk of dying? 

---
## Known fate

#### Who is at risk of dying?  

--
- Individuals who are **known** alive at the beginning of the interval  

--
    + Does not include individuals not yet marked (*staggered entry*)  

--
    + Does not include indivdiuals who's fates are unknown (*censoring*)
