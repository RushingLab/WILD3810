<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#course-description" class="anchor"></a>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This course is designed to introduce and review the factors that regulate and cause change in plant and animal populations. The relevance of population dynamics to conservation, management, ecology, and evolution will be covered. We will examine single-species, multi-species, age-structured, size-structured, and spatial models of population dynamics, as well as life history strategies. In addition to ecological concepts, students will be introduced to mathematical techniques and computer software that will allow them to examine population dynamics on their own as they embark on their careers.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-objectives" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#course-objectives" class="anchor"></a>COURSE OBJECTIVES</h1>

</li>
<li>Further refine quantitative and critical thinking skills</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="course-activities" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#course-activities" class="anchor"></a>COURSE ACTIVITIES</h1>
<div id="lectures" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#lectures" class="anchor"></a>Lectures</h2>
<p>Lectures will cover basic concepts regarding the dynamics of plant and animal populations. Mastering these topics is critical to doing well in the course so lecture attendance will count towards a small portion of your grade (~0.2% of your final grade per lecture) as an incentive for attending.</p>
</div>
<div id="labs" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#labs" class="anchor"></a>Labs</h2>
<p>Labs will consist primarily of computer-oriented sessions designed to help solidify the topics presented in lecture. All computer-based lab activities will use the free programming language <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>. In addition, we will run R using <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, a powerful <em>integrated development environment</em> (IDE) for R. Labs will meet in Quinney Library 306. You are welcome to use your own personal laptop computer (see below for instructions for installing R and RStudio if you plan to use your own computer). Much of the demonstration of how demography and population dynamics are monitored and assessed in the field will be covered in WILD 2400 and WILD 4750.</p>
<p>No previous experience with R is expected for this course. Lab activities, particularly those early in the semester, will be specifically designed to reinforce lecture topics as well as to introduce students to manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data using R.</p>
<p>During lab, students will work through pre-written code with the help of instructors. These activities will involve analyzing and visualizing data to deepen understanding of concepts presented in lecture.</p>
<div id="homework-assignments" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#homework-assignments" class="anchor"></a>Homework assignments</h3>
<p>Graded lab assignments will involve a combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short-answer questions based on the results of lab activities;</li>
<li>Changing/writing code to answer new questions not addressed in lab activities; and,</li>
<li>Short essays that link lab results to applied management/conservation issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Each assignment will consist of a <a href="https://rushinglab.github.io/WILD3810/articles/homework.html">R Markdown template</a> with questions and code. Portions of each assignment can be completed during lab. The remainder of the assignment will require students to take the results from their lab activities and complete assignments outside of class. Out-of-class work can either be completed on your own computer or by using the <a href="http://qcnr.usu.edu/quinney/computerlab_hours">computer lab facilities</a> in the Quinney Library.</p>
<p>All lab assignments must be turned in by the beginning of lab the following week. <strong>Late assignments are docked 20% of the grade for each day late.</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="quizzes" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#quizzes" class="anchor"></a>Quizzes</h2>
<p>Each week, students will be given a 10-question electronic quiz consisting of multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, matching, or TRUE/FALSE questions. Quizzes will be posted to Canvas and must be completed within one week of posting. Students may use lecture notes, textbooks, or the internet to answer questions but you must take the quiz yourself. <strong>Students may not work together on quizzes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quizzes that are not completed within one week will receive a grade of 0</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="exams" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#exams" class="anchor"></a>Exams</h2>
<p>This course will have two mid-term exams (worth 10% of your grade each) and one final exam (worth 25% of your grade). All exams will be cumulative to some extent because the major topics in the course build off of each other so understanding the topics covered later in the semester requires understanding the topics covered earlier in the semester. However, exams 2 and 3 will tend to focus on material covered since the previous exam.</p>
</div>

<a href="#lecture-and-lab-materials" class="anchor"></a>Lecture and lab materials</h2>
<p>PDF copies of each lecture will be posted on Canvas prior to class. Students are encouraged to download/print lectures ahead of class to aid notetaking. Please note, however, that lecture slides will not contain all of the details that will be discussed during lecture. Therefore, reviewing the slides is <em>not</em> a substitute for attending class.</p>
<p>Lab materials will also be distributed through Canvas prior to each lab. These materials will consist of files containing data and code. These materials can be downloaded prior to or at the beginning of lab.</p>
</div>
<div id="textbooks" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#textbooks" class="anchor"></a>Textbooks</h2>

<div id="software" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#software" class="anchor"></a>Software</h2>
<p>All lab computers will have R and RStudio installed on them so students are not required to install software on their own computers. However, students are free to use their own laptops during lab and having R and RStudio installed will make it easier to complete lab assignments outside of class. Any students wishing to use their own computers <strong>should have both R and RStudio installed and running prior to the first lab</strong>. Detailed instructions for installing both programs can be found <a href="http://stat545.com/block000_r-rstudio-install.html">here</a>. If you plan to use your own computer, be sure to test that you have everything installed correctly by doing the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Launch RStudio</p></li>
<li><p>Put the cursor in the window labelled <code>Console</code>. Type the following code followed by enter or return: <code>x &lt;- 2 * 4</code>. Next type <code>x</code> followed by enter or return. You should see the value 8 print to screen. If yes, you’ve succeeded in installing R and RStudio.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you encounter any problems with the previous steps, please contact me prior to the first lab.</p>

Faculty members are entitled to full freedom in teaching, research, and creative activities, subject to the limitations imposed by professional responsibility. Faculty Code Policy #403 further defines academic freedom and professional responsibilities.</p>

<a href="#academic-integrity-the-honor-system" class="anchor"></a>Academic Integrity – “The Honor System”</h2>
<p>Each student has the right and duty to pursue his or her academic experience free of dishonesty. To enhance the learning environment at Utah State University and to develop student academic integrity, each student agrees to the following Honor Pledge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>I pledge, on my honor, to conduct myself with the foremost level of academic integrity</em>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A student who lives by the Honor Pledge is a student who does more than not cheat, falsify, or plagiarize. A student who lives by the Honor Pledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Espouses academic integrity as an underlying and essential principle of the Utah State University community;</li>
<li>Understands that each act of academic dishonesty devalues every degree that is awarded by this institution; and</li>
<li>Is a welcomed and valued member of Utah State University.</li>

<a href="#sexual-harassmenttitle-ix" class="anchor"></a>Sexual Harassment/Title IX</h2>
<p>Utah State University is committed to creating and maintaining an environment free from acts of sexual misconduct and discrimination and to fostering respect and dignity for all members of the USU community. Title IX and USU Policy 339 address sexual harassment in the workplace and academic setting.</p>
<p>The university responds promptly upon learning of any form of possible discrimination or sexual misconduct. Any individual may contact USU’s <a href="http://aaeo.usu.edu/">Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity (AA/EO) Office</a> for available options and resources or clarification. The university has established a complaint procedure to handle all types of discrimination complaints, including sexual harassment (<a href="http://www.usu.edu/policies/305/">USU Policy 305</a>), and has designated the AA/EO Director/Title IX Coordinator as the official responsible for receiving and investigating complaints of sexual harassment.</p>

<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#assumption-of-risk" class="anchor"></a>Assumption of Risk</h2>
<p>All classes, programs, and extracurricular activities within the University involve some risk, and certain ones involve travel. The University provides opportunities to participate in these programs on a voluntary basis. Therefore, students should not participate in them if they do not care to assume the risks. Students can ask the respective program leaders/sponsors about the possible risks a program may generate, and if students are not willing to assume the risks, they should not select that program. By voluntarily participating in classes, programs, and extracurricular activities, a student does so at his or her own risk. General information about University Risk Management policies, insurance coverage, vehicle use policies, and risk management forms can be found at: <a href="http://www.usu.edu/riskmgt/" class="uri">http://www.usu.edu/riskmgt/</a></p>

<p>Students are required to complete all courses for which they are registered by the end of the semester. In some cases, a student may be unable to complete all of the coursework because of extenuating circumstances, but not due to poor performance or to retain financial aid. The term ‘extenuating’ circumstances includes: (1) incapacitating illness which prevents a student from attending classes for a minimum period of two weeks, (2) a death in the immediate family, (3) financial responsibilities requiring a student to alter a work schedule to secure employment, (4) change in work schedule as required by an employer, or (5) other emergencies deemed appropriate by the instructor.</p>

<p>In the case of a drill or real emergency, classes will be notified to evacuate the building by the sound of the fire/emergency alarm system or by a building representative. In the event of a disaster that may interfere with either notification, evacuate as the situation dictates (i.e., in an earthquake when shaking ceases or immediately when a fire is discovered). Turn off computers and take any personal items with you. Elevators should not be used; instead, use the closest stairs.</p>
