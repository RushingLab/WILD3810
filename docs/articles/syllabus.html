<a href="#course-objectives" class="anchor"></a>COURSE OBJECTIVES</h1>
<p>These quantitative skills underpin modern conservation biology, natural resource management, population ecology and related fields, and will increase competitiveness for those seeking careers in these fields. Individuals that have great difficulty with basic mathematics and statistics should not be discouraged, but will have to spend a little more time working on the course material.</p>
<p>Overall, my three main objectives are for you to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Gain factual knowledge (terminology, methods, and trends) in plant and animal population ecology.</li>
<li>Learn to apply course material to conservation, management, and ecological problems (to improve thinking, problem solving, and decisions) using mathematics and computer software.</li>
<li>Develop specific skills and competencies in problem solving, ecological hypotheses development related to population ecology of plants and animals.</li>

<a href="#assumption-of-risk" class="anchor"></a>ASSUMPTION OF RISK</h1>
<p>All classes, programs, and extracurricular activities within the University involve some risk, and certain ones involve travel. The University provides opportunities to participate in these programs on a voluntary basis. Therefore, students should not participate in them if they do not care to assume the risks. Students can ask the respective program leaders/sponsors about the possible risks a program may generate, and if students are not willing to assume the risks, they should not select that program. By voluntarily participating in classes, programs, and extracurricular activities, a student does so at his or her own risk. General information about University Risk Management policies, insurance coverage, vehicle use policies, and risk management forms can be found at: <a href="http://www.usu.edu/riskmgt/" class="uri">http://www.usu.edu/riskmgt/</a></p>

<p>Utah State University supports the principle of freedom of expression for both faculty and students. The University respects the rights of faculty to teach and students to learn. Maintenance of these rights requires classroom conditions that do not impede the learning process. Disruptive classroom behavior will not be tolerated. An individual engaging in such behavior may be subject to disciplinary action.

<p>Academic freedom is the right to teach, study, discuss, investigate, discover, create, and publish freely. Academic freedom protects the rights of faculty members in teaching and of students in learning. Freedom in research is fundamental to the advancement of truth. Faculty members are entitled to full freedom in teaching, research, and creative activities, subject to the limitations imposed by professional responsibility. Faculty Code Policy #403 further defines academic freedom and professional responsibilities.</p>

<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#academic-integrity-the-honor-system" class="anchor"></a>Academic Integrity – “The Honor System”</h2>
<p>Each student has the right and duty to pursue his or her academic experience free of dishonesty. To enhance the learning environment at Utah State University and to develop student academic integrity, each student agrees to the following Honor Pledge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>I pledge, on my honor, to conduct myself with the foremost level of academic integrity</em>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A student who lives by the Honor Pledge is a student who does more than not cheat, falsify, or plagiarize. A student who lives by the Honor Pledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Espouses academic integrity as an underlying and essential principle of the Utah State University community;</li>
<li>Understands that each act of academic dishonesty devalues every degree that is awarded by this institution; and</li>
<li>Is a welcomed and valued member of Utah State University.</li>
</ul>

<li>Continuing to write after time has been called on a quiz, test, examination, or any other academic exercise or activity;</li>
<li>Submitting substantially the same work for credit in more than one class, except with prior approval of the instructor; or engaging in any form of research fraud.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Falsification</strong>: altering or fabricating any information or citation in an academic exercise or activity.</li>
<li>
<strong>Plagiarism</strong>: representing, by paraphrase or direct quotation, the published or unpublished work of another person as one‘s own in any academic exercise or activity without full and clear acknowledgment. It also includes using materials prepared by another person or by an agency engaged in the sale of term papers or other academic materials.</li>

<p>Utah State University is committed to creating and maintaining an environment free from acts of sexual misconduct and discrimination and to fostering respect and dignity for all members of the USU community.

<p>Students are required to complete all courses for which they are registered by the end of the semester. In some cases, a student may be unable to complete all of the coursework because of extenuating circumstances, but not due to poor performance or to retain financial aid. The term ‘extenuating’ circumstances includes: (1) incapacitating illness which prevents a student from attending classes for a minimum period of two weeks, (2) a death in the immediate family, (3) financial responsibilities requiring a student to alter a work schedule to secure employment, (4) change in work schedule as required by an employer, or (5) other emergencies deemed appropriate by the instructor.</p>

In the event of a disaster that may interfere with either notification, evacuate as the situation dictates (i.e., in an earthquake when shaking ceases or immediately when a fire is discovered). Turn off computers and take any personal items with you. Elevators should not be used; instead, use the closest stairs.</p>
