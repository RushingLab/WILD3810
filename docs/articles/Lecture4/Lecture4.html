## Density-independence vs density-dependence

In the last lecture, we learned about population growth models that assume demographic rates are unrelated to population size

---
## Density-independence vs density-dependence

We also learned that this assumption leads to exponential population growth

&lt;img src="Lecture4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Limitless population growth?

No population can grow exponentially forever (or even for relatively short periods of time)  

--
Thomas Malthus was the first to propose that no population could grow without bound forever (1798)  

+ At some point, resources will be become limited and populations must either stop growing or decline

&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Thomas_Robert_Malthus.jpg" width="150" height="200" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


--
Malthus' work inspired Darwin (1859) to suggest that limitation of resources is what drives evolution by natural selection

---
## Competition

At small population sizes, individual organisms may be able to acquire all of the resources they need to survive and reproduce  

As `\(N\)` increases, the availability of resources per organism will decrease, leading to increased competition  

--
**Intra-specific competition:**  

&gt; interaction between individuals of a single species brought about by the need for a shared resource


--
Intra-specific competition can arise in multiple ways:

.pull-left[
**Animals**
 * food
 * shelter
 * breeding sites
 * mates
 ]
 
 .pull-right[
 **Plants**
 * space
 * light
 * water
 * nutrients
]

---
## Competition

Ecologists generally distinguish between two types of competition:  

--
1) **Exploitation competition**  

+ consumption of limited resource by individuals depletes the amount available for others  

+ also known as: depletion, consumption, or scramble competition  

+ *indirect*

## Competition

Ecologists generally distinguish between two types of competition:  

1) **Exploitation competition**  

2) **Interference competition**  

+ individuals actively prevent others from attaining a resource in a given area or territory  

+ also known as: encounter or contest competition  

+ *direct*

## Competition

As population size increases, the resources available to each individual will eventually shrink to the point where demographic parameters are negatively effected  

+ Increased density can also increase rates of disease transmission

## Competition

As population size increases, the resources available to each individual will eventually shrink to the point where demographic parameters are negatively effected  


&lt;img src="Lecture4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Carrying-capacity

Remember that the population growth rate `\(r = b -d\)`  
&lt;br/&gt;

--
If `\(b = d\)`:  

--
+ `\(r = 0\)`  

--
+ population remains stable  


--
If `\(b \gt d\)`:  

--
+ `\(r \gt 0\)`  

--
+ population will grow  


--
If `\(d \gt b\)`:  

--
+ `\(r \lt 0\)`  

--
+ population will decrease  

---
## Carrying-capacity

&lt;img src="Lecture4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Carrying-capacity

&lt;img src="Lecture4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???

Left of the intersection, `\(r\)` is positive so the population will grow

---
## Carrying-capacity

&lt;img src="Lecture4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???

Right of the intersection, `\(r\)` is negative so the population will shrink

---
## Carrying capacity

Carrying capacity `\(K\)`:

&gt; the population size that the environment can maintain `\(^1\)`

&lt;img src="Lecture4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???

`\(^1\)` At the intersection, `\(r\)` is 0 so the population will be stable

---
## Population regulation vs limitation

The density-dependent processes we just learned about are called **regulating** factors  

+ Regulating factors keep population size from going too far above or below `\(K\)` `\(^2\)` 


&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/OfficeThermostat.jpg" width="400" height="200" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

**Limiting** factors determine the actual value of `\(K\)`  

+ Limiting factors can be density-dependent (competition) or density independent (disturbance or extreme weather)


???

`\(^2\)` Think of regulating factors like a thermostat - if the temperature goes below the desired temperature ($N &lt; K$), the heater kicks on ($b$ increases). If once the temperature increases above the set temperature ($N &gt; K$), the heater turns off ($d$ increases)

# Models of density-dependent population growth

---
## Models of D-D population growth

Remember the (continuous time) density-independent model of population growth:  

`$$\frac{dN}{dt} = N \times r$$`  

How can we modify this equation to include density-dependence?  

To start, remember what density-dependence means:

&gt; the rate of population growth decreases as population size increases

---
## Models of D-D population growth

A good starting point for this is a linear response that looks something like this:

&lt;img src="Lecture4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Models of D-D population growth

How do we add this relationship to our model?  

--
Remember the equation for a line: `\(^3\)`  

`$$y = ax + b$$`  

In our model, we can write this as: `\(^4\)`  

`$$r = aN + c$$`.

???

`\(^3\)` is the y-intercept (the value of `\(y\)` when `\(x=0\)`) and `\(a\)` is the slope (the change in `\(r\)` per unit change is `\(x\)`).  

`\(^4\)`I changed the y-intercept to `\(c\)` to ensure that it is not confused with the birth rate `\(b\)`

---
## Models of D-D population growth

In our population model, `\(c\)` represents the rate of increase when the population is 0  

We can see in the figure that this is the largest value of `\(r\)` the population can experience  

+ Call that `\(r_0\)`  

+ Because `\(r_0\)` the maximum rate of increase (nothing limiting population growth), it is equivalent to `\(r\)` in the D-I model  

&lt;img src="Lecture4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
## Models of D-D population growth

What is `\(a\)`, the slope of the relationship between `\(r\)` and `\(N\)`?  

--
+ It has to be negative ($r$ has to decrease as `\(N\)` increases)  


--
Remember that `\(r=0\)` when `\(N=K\)`, so:

`$$0 = aK + r_0$$`

therefore,

--

`$$a = -\frac{r_0}{K}$$`

&lt;img src="Lecture4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Models of D-D population growth

We now have a full equation for the relationship between `\(r\)` and `\(N\)`:

`$$r = -\frac{r_0}{K}N + r_0$$`

which simplifies to: `\(^5\)`   

`$$r = r_0 \bigg(1-\frac{N}{K}\bigg)$$`

???

`\(^5\)` Details about model derivation: 

`$$r = -\frac{r_0}{K}N + r_0$$`

simplifies to:

`$$r = r_0 -\frac{r_0}{K}N$$`

simplifies to:

`$$r = r_0 \bigg(1-\frac{1}{K}N\bigg)$$`

simplifies to:

`$$r = r_0 \bigg(1-\frac{N}{K}\bigg)$$`

---
## Models of D-D population growth

How does this work?  

--
Assume `\(r_0 = 1\)` and `\(K = 1000\)`  

--
What is the population growth rate when `\(N=100\)`?  

+ `\(r = 1 - \frac{100}{1000}=\)` 0.9  


--
What about when `\(N=500\)`? 0.5  

+ `\(r = 1 - \frac{500}{1000}=\)` 0.5  


--
When `\(N=1000\)`?  

+ `\(r = 1 - \frac{1000}{1000}=\)` 0

---
## Models of D-D population growth

Now let's insert our new equation for `\(r\)` into the population growth model:

`$$\frac{dN}{dt} = N \times r_0 \bigg(1-\frac{N}{K}\bigg)$$`

--
This is called the **logistic growth model**  
&lt;br/&gt;

--
How does this work? Again, `\(r_0 = 1\)` and `\(K = 1000\)`  

--
What is `\(\frac{dN}{dt}\)` when `\(N=100\)`?  

+ `\(\frac{dN}{dt} = 100 \times 1 \bigg(1-\frac{100}{1000}\bigg)=\)` 90  


--
What about when `\(N=500\)`?  

+ `\(\frac{dN}{dt} = 500 \times 1 \bigg(1-\frac{500}{1000}\bigg)=\)` 250  


--
When `\(N=1000\)`?  

+ `\(\frac{dN}{dt} = 1000 \times 1 \bigg(1-\frac{1000}{1000}\bigg)=\)` 0

???

What happens to `\(\frac{dN}{dt}\)` when `\(N &gt; K\)`? 


---
## Models of D-D population growth

How does this work? `\(^6\)`

&lt;img src="Lecture4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???

`\(^6\)` Thickness and color of line correspond to magnitude of population change (thicker and darker red correspond to larger rate of change)  

Rate of change is largest when abundance is at half of the carrying capacity `\(\bigg(N = \frac{K}{2}\bigg)\)`  

Above `\(K\)`, the rate of change becomes negative

# Non-linear effects

---
## Non-linear effects

The logistic model assumes that `\(r\)` decreases linearly with increasing `\(N\)`  

--
In reality, this relationship is not likely to be linear, for example:  

--
+ `\(r\)` might not change much (or at all) until population size is high enough that resources start to become limited  

--
+ `\(r\)` decrease very quickly if resources are used rapidly by additional individuals  


--
We can make the logistic model more flexible by adding a new term, `\(\theta\)`: `\(^7\)`

`$$\frac{dN}{dt} = r_0N\bigg(1-\bigg[\frac{N}{K}\bigg]^\theta\bigg)$$`

???

`\(^7\)` When `\(\theta = 1\)`, this model is the original logistic model

---
## Non-linear effects

When `\(\theta &gt; 1\)`, `\(r\)` does not respond to `\(N\)` until `\(N\)` is big enough that resources become limiting

&lt;img src="Lecture4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Non-linear effects

If `\(\theta &lt; 1\)`, resources quickly become scarce, and `\(r\)` is suppressed even at low `\(N\)`

# Allee effects

---
## Allee effects

So far, we have assumed that `\(b\)` and `\(d\)` (and therefore `\(r\)`) decrease as population size increases  

+ This is called *negative* density dependence   


--
In some cases, the slope could also be positive  

+ Positive relationships between `\(N\)` and `\(d\)` or `\(b\)` generally occur at small population sizes

&lt;img src="Lecture4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Allee effects

Why might the death rate be high at small `\(N\)`?  

--
* Group signaling breaks down, predation increases  

--
* Cooperative foraging becomes less efficient  

--
* Inbreeding depression  


--
Why might the birth rate be low at small `\(N\)`?  

--
* Pollination failure  

--
* Unable to find mates because of rarity  

--
* Unable to find mates because of skewed sex ratio  

--
* Inbreeding depression

---
## Allee effects

When abundance drops below the minimum viable population (MVP), the population will likely approach extinction without help!

# Discrete dynamics

---
## Discrete dynamics

Remember the discrete-time model of density-independent growth  

`$$N_{t+1} = N_t \lambda$$`

--
As before, we need to account for possible changes in `\(\lambda\)` caused by changes in population density  


--
Remember that:  

`$$\lambda = e^r$$`  

and:  
`$$r = r_0\bigg(1 - \frac{N}{K}\bigg)$$`

---
## Discrete dynamics

Therefore, one discrete-time density-dependent growth model is:   

`$$N_{t+1}=N_t e^{\bigg[r_0\bigg(1 - \frac{N}{K}\bigg)\bigg]}$$`

This known as the **Ricker model**  

&lt;img src="Lecture4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Discrete dynamics

Any adjustment that can be made to the continuous time logistic model can also be made to the Ricker model  

`$$N_{t+1}=N_t e^{\bigg[r_0\bigg(1 - \bigg[\frac{N}{K}\bigg]^\theta\bigg)\bigg]}$$`
