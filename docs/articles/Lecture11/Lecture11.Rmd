## Assumptions of the B-D models

#### Over the coming weeks, we will learn about why and how to relax assumption 3:  


1) Population closed to immigration and emigration  
<br/>


2) Model pertains to only the limiting sex, usually females  
<br/>


**3) Birth and death rates are independent of an individualâ€™s age or biological stage**  
<br/>


4) Birth and death rates are constant

### **How can we model population dynamics of populations with complex age structure?**

## Age-structured demography

### Consider the following life table:
<br/>

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
lt <- data.frame(x = c(0,1,2,3),
                       mx = c(0, "\\(m_1\\)", "\\(m_2\\)", "\\(m_3\\)"),
                       px = c("\\(P_0\\)", "\\(P_1\\)", "\\(P_2\\)", 0))

names(lt) <- c("\\(x\\)", "\\(m_x\\)", "\\(P_x\\)")

lt %>%
  kable("html", align = 'c', escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = TRUE, font_size = 22) 
```

???

What do $m_x$ and $P_x$ represent?  

What can you say about the reproductive and survival schedules of this population?

## Age-structred demography

#### List population abundance in discrete 1-year age classes $\LARGE (n_i)$  

- e.g., $\LARGE n_1$, $\LARGE n_2$, $\LARGE n_3$  

- $\LARGE n_i$ is the number of individuals about to experience their $\LARGE i^{th}$ birthday
