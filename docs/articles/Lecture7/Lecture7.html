# Stochasticity and extinction risk

Remember from the last lecture that, over a long enough time scales, the fate of any population that is subject to stochasticity is extinction  

&lt;img src="Lecture7_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Stochasticity and extinction risk

We also learned that stochasticity, particularly demographic stochasticity, is most consequential at small population sizes  

&lt;img src="Lecture7_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Genetic stochasticity 

In addition to demographic and environmental stochasticity, **genetic stochasticity** can also increase extinction risk for small populations  
&lt;br/&gt;  

Genetic drift leads to random accumulation and expression of harmful alleles, which can reduce demographic rates `\(^1\)`  
&lt;br/&gt;

Inbreeding depression can also lead to expression of harmful alleles

???
`\(^1\)` This is very similar to demographic stochasticity - just by chance, it is possible to get a string of bad luck, in this case expression of alleles that are harmful  

Like demographic stochasticity, drift is more likely to be consequential at small population sizes

# Extinction vortex


---
## Extinction vortex

As populations decrease in size, they reach a point where environmental stochasticity, demographic stochasticity, and genetic stochasticity all interact to drive populations towards extinction, the so called **extinction vortex**  

&lt;img src="extinction_vortex.png" width="500" height="300" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Extinction vortex

The danger with the extinction vortex is that focusing on a single factor - for example the deterministic cause of decline - is not enough   
&lt;br/&gt;

--
Once a population is small, removing the cause of decline will not remove the stochastic threats  
&lt;br/&gt;

--
All threats have to be managed and considered together 

---
## What is a "small" population?

Detecting when species have entered the extinction vortex is difficult in the field  
&lt;br/&gt;

--
But risk of exinction is related to population size  

+ small populations are at higher risk than large ones   
&lt;br/&gt;


--
But what defines a "small" population? 

---
## What is a "small" population?

This is a difficult question because "small" is a relative term  
&lt;br/&gt;

--
"Small" compared to what? 

--
+ Historical population size (use Wood Thrush)?  

--
+ Other species (Rare and stable vs. common and declining)?  

--
+ Management standards (duck vs. cougar)? 


---
## What is a "small" population?

There is a long history of trying to define abundance thresholds that can be used to trigger management actions (*minimum viable population*):

1) 50-500 rules (Soule 1980; Frankel &amp; Soule 1981):  

&gt; Effective population size `\((N_e)\)` of 50 needed to avoid negative consequences of inbreeding depression; `\(N_e=500\)` needed for maintenence of genetic diversity to allow adapation `\(^1\)` 

Focused on captive breeding not wild populations  

`\(N_e=500\)` probably too small for wild populations subject to stochasticity

???

`\(^1\)` Effective population size is  

`\(N_e=50\)` translates to about 200-250 individuals

---
## What is a "small" population?

There is a long history of trying to define abundance thresholds that can be used to trigger management actions (*minimum viable population*):

1) 50-500 rules (Soule 1980; Frankel &amp; Soule 1981)

2) 1400-4000 (Brook et al. 2006; Traill et al. 2007): 

&gt; 1400-4000 individuals found to promote low risk of extinction over moderate timescales (20-100 years)

Improvement over 50-500 rule because focuses is on "risk of extinction" rather than on abundance itself  

Good rule-of-thumb but not a magic number  

---
## Problems with MVP approach

--
1) we probably don't want to aim for the *minimum* population size  
&lt;br/&gt;

--
2) there is not really a single minimum number of individuals (uncertainty!)  
&lt;br/&gt;

--
3) populations provide ecological functions that may not be met at low population sizes  
&lt;br/&gt;


--
Many factors influence risk of extinction so maintenence of a population should consider multiple risk factors

# Predictors of exinction risk

---
## Predictors of exinction risk

1)  Abundance  

* smaller populations are at higher risk of extinction than larger ones `\(^1\)`

???

`\(^1\)`due to the larger consequences of stochastic events

---
## Predictors of exinction risk

1)  Abundance  

2)  Range size  

--
* Species restricted to small area/highly specialized are often at a higher risk of extinction than widespread species  

--
* This is because:  

    a) small range and specialization are generally correlated with population size; and  
    b) the restricted habitats used by these species are at higher risk of catestrophic loss

## Predictors of exinction risk

1)  Abundance  

2)  Range size  

3) Population growth rate  

* Species with low and/or highly variable growth rates are at higher risk of exinction than species with stable and/or high growth rates  

---
## Predictors of exinction risk

1)  Abundance  

2)  Range size  

3) Population growth rate  

4) Body size  

* Population growth rate and abundance tend to decrease with increasing body size so large-bodied species are generallly at higher risk than small bodied species

---
## Predictors of exinction risk

1)  Abundance  

2)  Range size  

3) Population growth rate  

4) Body size  

5) Movement  

* Species that are able to colonize new habitats are generally at lower risk of exintinction because:

    a) They are better able to locate and colonize suitable habitat when it becomes avaiable; and  
    b) increase gene flow limits drift/inbreeding and allows for adaptation

# Population viability analysis

---
## Population viability analysis

The above criteria have proven to be useful for predicting which species are vulnerable to extinction  
&lt;br/&gt;

--
However, due to the complex and interacting factors that determine exinctition risk, these criteria are often too simple to accurately assess true risk of exinction   
&lt;br/&gt;

--
When data are available, a more useful tool for predicting extinction risk is *population viability analysis* (PVA)  
&lt;br/&gt;

--
PVA is a tool (or more accurately a set of methods) that:  

&gt; use data and models to estimate the likelihoods of a population crossing thresholds of vaibility within various time spans, and to give insights into factors that constitute the biggest threats `\(^1\)`  

&lt;br/&gt;

--
Unlike minimum viable populations, PVA provides a means of determining "population viability" without the need to set a threshold abundance

???

`\(^1\)` quoted from Mills pg 227  

In lab, we will practice implementing a PVA using R. For now, we will discuss the different parts of the definition, different types of PVA, and how PVA is used to inform management decisions.

---
## Components of a PVA

1) Viability  

- The first step of a PVA is defining what we mean by viable  

- This is an abundance level that we want to maintain our population at or above  

- In the most simple cases, a viable means not extinct `\((N &gt; 0)\)`   


--
Usually, we not only want to prevent extinction, we also want keep abundance above some level where, e.g.

--
- Allee effects might kick in  

--
- ecological functions are detrimented  

--
- monitoring becomes unreliable  

---
## Components of a PVA

1) Viability  

Thus, PVA is usually based on *quasi-extinction* thresholds that are `\(&gt; 0\)`  

Below these thresholds, some management action `\(^1\)` might be triggered to prevent absolute extinction  

???

`\(^1\)` captive breeding or special management actions

---
## Components of a PVA

1) Viability  
&lt;br/&gt;

2) Timeframe  

- As we learned earlier, over long enough time periods, every population will go extinct  

- Critical to determine the specific timeframe *relevant to our management objectives*  

--
One of the central issues with any type of prediction is that predictions are less certain the farther in the future we try to project  

The longer the time frame, the more ways there are for stochastic sources of variation to accumulate  

---
## Components of a PVA

1) Viability  
&lt;br/&gt;

2) Timeframe  

Most PVAs therefore incorporate both short-term and long-term objectives  

--
- Long-term objectives are generally based soley on biology - maintaining populations above the quasi-extinction threshold for several decades  

--
- Short-term goals are more focused on political, legal, and social realities - what *can* we do now to maintain or increase population viability?  


--
By monitoring the population and re-running the PVA with new data, managers can assess whether short-term actions are helping (or hurting) meet long-term objectives.

---
## Components of a PVA

1) Viability  
&lt;br/&gt;

2) Timeframe  
&lt;br/&gt;

3) Likelihood of risk  

- The reason we need PVA is that we cannot say with certainty what will happen in the future due to stochasticity `\(^1\)`  

--
- PVAs are based on estimating probabilities of meeting viability objectives over our defined timeframes  
- These probabilities capture the inherent *uncertainty* in our predictions  

???

`\(^1\)` as well as deterministic processes that may occur in the future


---
## Components of a PVA

1) Viability  
&lt;br/&gt;

2) Timeframe  
&lt;br/&gt;

3) Likelihood of risk  

- The likelihood of risk can be expressed in different ways  

-- 
For example, the cumulative probability of declining below the quasi-extinction threshold over time

&lt;img src="Lecture7_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Components of a PVA

1) Viability  
&lt;br/&gt;

2) Timeframe  
&lt;br/&gt;

3) Likelihood of risk  

- The likelihood of risk can be expressed in different ways  


Or we may express the probability that the population declines a specified amount over a given amount of time `\(^1\)`

???

`\(^1\)` For example, the probability that the population declines 50% after 25 years. 

---
## Components of a PVA

1) Viability  
&lt;br/&gt;

2) Timeframe  
&lt;br/&gt;

3) Likelihood of risk  

In all cases, it's important to remember that these are *probabililities* - we don't know exactly how things will turn out  

PVA can be used to estimate these probabilities but they cannot be used to tell us what level of risk we are willing to accept. That is a value judgement.

# Types of PVA

---
## Types of PVA 

Once we have established our quasi-exinction thresholds, timeframes, and likelihoods of risk, we can build the PVA  
&lt;br/&gt;

--
As mentioned above, PVA actually refers to a variety of modeling techniques  
&lt;br/&gt;

--
The type of PVA we choose usually depends on the available data

---
## Types of PVA

#### Time-series

The most straightforward type of PVA is based on a time series of abundance data  

---
## Types of PVA

#### Demographically-explicit 

---
## Types of PVA

#### Spatial
