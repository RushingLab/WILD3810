### Population ecology is the study of the distribution of individuals in a population over time and space
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

`$$\Huge N = B + I + D +E$$`


---
## Assumptions of the exponential growth model 

1) Population closed to immigration and emigration  
&lt;br/&gt;

2) Model pertains to only the limiting sex, usually females  
&lt;br/&gt;

3) Birth and death rates are independent of an individual’s age or biological stage  
&lt;br/&gt;

4) Birth and death rates are constant

# Dispersal

---
## Dispersal

&gt; Movement of an individual from one location to another for the purposes of breeding


- also defined as movements that *can* result in gene flow  


--
#### Types of dispersal

1) Natal dispersal

&gt; Movement of an individual from its birth location to its first breeding location  


--
2) Breeding dispersal

&gt; Movement of an individual between breeding attempts

---
## Dispersal

#### Three stages

1) Emigration

## Dispersal

#### Three stages

1) Emigration

2) Search

## Why disperse?

#### Find mates

---
## Why disperse?

#### Find mates

#### Avoid inbreeding

&lt;img src="figs/inbreeding.jpg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
## Why disperse?

#### Find mates

#### Avoid inbreeding

#### Avoid kin competition

&lt;img src="figs/mannings.jpg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Why not disperse?

#### In some cases, remaining in your current patch (**philopatry**) is beneficial because:

- Search phase can be risky and energetically costly

- "Home field" advantage 

- Loss of kin cooperation

- Competition in new patch


--
Trade-offs between the costs and benefits of dispersal may differ between sexes, populations, and species

- In birds, females often disperse more than males (males benefit from defending territory)

- In mammals, males often disperse more than females (males benefit from defending mates)

---
## How does dispersal influence population dynamics?

#### Movement of individuals can:

- reduce local population size `\((E)\)`

- increase local population size `\((I)\)`

- increase genetic diversity


--
#### Dispersal can link the dynamics of populations that would otherwise be independent

- metapopulation: a population of populations

---
## When are populations a metapopulation?

#### Fragmentation creates patches of suitable habitat surrounded by unsuitable habitat

- if *connectivity* between patches is low, dynamics of local populations will be independent
    + patches that go extinct have little chance of being colonized
    
&lt;img src="figs/isolated.png" width="30%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
## When are populations a metapopulation?

#### Fragmentation creates patches of suitable habitat surrounded by unsuitable habitat

- if connectivity between patches is very high, populations will act as a single, large population
    + very low probability that patches will go extinct
    + "patchy population"
    
&lt;img src="figs/patchy.png" width="30%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## When are populations a metapopulation?

#### Fragmentation creates patches of suitable habitat surrounded by unsuitable habitat

- if connectivity between patches is moderate, populations can go extinct and be re-colonized
    + at any given time, some sites will be occupied and some will not
    + patches will "blink" on and off
    + metapopulation

## Levins' metapopulation model

#### Developed originally by Richard Levins

- simple model describing the occupancy of local patches

--
- each patch can be occupied (1) or unoccupied (0)
    + ignores local population dynamics

--
- at each time step, occupied patches go extinct with probability `\(\Large \epsilon\)` 

--
- unoccupied patches can be colonized with probability `\(\Large \gamma\)`
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

--
- objective is to estimate the fraction of patches occupied, `\(\Large \psi\)`

---
## Levins' metapopulation model

#### Spatial configuration of patches is ignored
- all patches have the same probability of being colonized regardless of their location
    
&lt;img src="figs/levins1.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Levins' metapopulation model

#### At any point in time, what proportion of sites will go extinct?

--
`$$\Large E = \psi \epsilon$$`

&lt;img src="Lecture14_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Levins' metapopulation model

#### At any point in time, what proportion of sites will be colonized?

`$$\Large I = \gamma \psi (1 - \psi)$$`

&lt;img src="Lecture14_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Levins' metapopulation model

#### At any point in time, what proportion of sites will be occupied?

`$$\Large \psi = 1 - \frac{\epsilon}{\gamma}$$`

- Although `\(\large \psi\)`% of patches are expected to be occupied at any point in time, *which* sites are occupied will change
    + leads to patches "blinking" on and off
    
&lt;img src="Lecture14_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
## Metapopulation persistance

#### If `\(\Large \epsilon\)` is the probability that 1 patch goes extinct:

- probability that it doesn't go extinct (persistence) is `\(\large 1 - \epsilon\)`


--
#### What is the probability that a metapopulation composed of two patches does **not** go extinct? 

--
`$$\LARGE 1 - \epsilon \times \epsilon$$`


--
#### What is the probability that a metapopulation composed of `\(\large n\)` patches does not go extinct? 

--
`$$\LARGE 1 - \epsilon^n$$`

---
## Metapopulation persistance

#### More patches = lower metapopulation extinction risk 
- unoccupied sites are "rescued" by colonization from occupied sites
- critical to maintain patches, even if they are currently unoccupied
- connectivity of patches important for increasing colonization probability

&lt;img src="Lecture14_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
## Assumptions of the Levins model

- `\(\large \gamma\)` and `\(\large \epsilon\)` are the same for every patch  
&lt;br/&gt;
- `\(\large \gamma\)` and `\(\large \epsilon\)` are constant over time  
&lt;br/&gt;
- `\(\large \gamma\)` and `\(\large \epsilon\)` are independent of patch size  
&lt;br/&gt;
- `\(\large \gamma\)` and `\(\large \epsilon\)` are independent of distance of patch to other patches  
&lt;br/&gt;
- `\(\large \gamma\)` and `\(\large \epsilon\)` are independent of population density  
&lt;br/&gt;
- Local birth-death dynamics are ignored
