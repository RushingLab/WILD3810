<h1>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This course is designed to introduce and review the factors that regulate and cause change in plant and animal populations. The relevance of population dynamics to conservation, management, ecology, and evolution will be covered. We will examine single-species, multi-species, age-structured, size-structured, and spatial models of population dynamics, as well as life history strategies. In addition to ecological concepts, students will be introduced to mathematical techniques and computer software that will allow them to examine population dynamics on their own as they embark on their careers.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-objectives" class="section level1">
<h1>COURSE OBJECTIVES</h1>
<p>These quantitative skills underpin modern conservation biology, natural resource management, population ecology and related fields, and will increase competitiveness for those seeking careers in these fields. Individuals that have great difficulty with basic mathematics and statistics should not be discouraged, but will have to spend a little more time working on the course material.</p>
<p>Overall, my three main objectives are for you to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Gain factual knowledge (terminology, methods, and trends) in plant and animal population ecology.</li>
<li>Learn to apply course material to conservation, management, and ecological problems (to improve thinking, problem solving, and decisions) using mathematics and computer software.</li>
<li><p>Develop specific skills and competencies in problem solving, ecological hypotheses development related to population ecology of plants and animals.</p></li>
<li>Understand general concepts of plant &amp; animal population dynamics</li>
<li>Gain experience using mathematics and computer software to examine dynamics of plant and animal populations</li>
<li>Apply the following skills learned in other classes:</li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Data entry</li>
<li>Application of basic statistical tests</li>
<li>Graphical presentation of data and statistical results</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Analyze data and use models to project future plant &amp; animal population conditions resulting from management or anthropogenic disturbances</li>
<li>Further refine quantitative and critical thinking skills</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h1>COURSE ACTIVITIES</h1>
<div id="lectures" class="section level2">
<h2>Lectures</h2>
</div>
<div id="labs" class="section level2">
<h2>Labs</h2>
<p>Labs will consist primarily of computer-oriented sessions designed to help solidify the topics presented in lecture. Recent versions of Microsoft Excel will be the primary software used, but students will also gain a soft introduction to the R programming language, and use R as a port to other software (e.g. Program MARK). Labs will meet in Quinney Library 304, but some students may need to spill over into 306 depending on enrollment. You are welcome to use your own personal laptop computer. Much of the demonstration of how demography and population dynamics are monitored and assessed in the field will be covered in WILD 2400 and WILD 4750.</p>
</div>

<div id="course-resources" class="section level1">
<h1>COURSE RESOURCES</h1>
<div id="lecture-and-lab-materials" class="section level2">
<h2>Lecture and lab materials</h2>
<p>PDF copies of each lecture will be posted on Canvas prior to class. Students are encouraged to download/print lectures ahead of class to aid notetaking. Please note, however, that lecture slides will not contain all of the details that will be discussed during lecture. Therefore, reviewing the slides is <em>not</em> a substitute for attending class.</p>
<p>Lab materials will also be distributed through Canvas prior to each lab. These materials will consist of files containing data and code. These materials can be downloaded prior to or at the beginning of lab.</p>
</div>
<div id="textbooks" class="section level2">
<h2>Textbooks</h2>
<p>The primary text for this course is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mills, L.S. 2012. <em>Conservation of Wildlife Populations: Demography, Genetics, and Management.</em> Blackwell Publishing, Malden, MA</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New and used copies can be bought or rented from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Conservation-Wildlife-Populations-Demography-Management/dp/0470671491/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1541177542&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=mills+conservation">Amazon</a>. If you find a cheap copy of the first edition, that is fine.</p>
<p>Additional readings will be assigned from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Powell, L.A. and Gale, G.A. 2015. <em>Estimation of Parameters for Animal Populations: A Primer for the Rest of Us. Caught Napping Publications.</em> Lincoln, NE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PDF versions of all chapters are available for free <a href="http://larkinpowell.wixsite.com/larkinpowell/estimation-of-parameters-for-animal-pop">here</a>. Links to purchase hard copies ($17.50) can be found by clicking on the previous link.</p>
</div>
<div id="software" class="section level2">
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>All computer-based lab activities will use the free programming language <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>. In addition, we will run R using <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, a powerful <em>integrated development environment</em> (IDE) for R.</p>
<p>All lab computers will have R and RStudio installed on them so students are not required to install software on their own computers. However, students are free to use their own laptops during lab and having R and RStudio installed will make it easier to complete lab assignments outside of class. Any students wishing to use their own computers <strong>should have both R and RStudio installed and running prior to the first lab</strong>. Detailed instructions for installing both programs can be found <a href="http://stat545.com/block000_r-rstudio-install.html">here</a>. If you plan to use your own computer, be sure to test that you have everything installed correctly by doing the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Launch RStudio</p></li>
<li><p>Put the cursor in the window labelled <code>Console</code>. Type the following code followed by enter or return: <code>x &lt;- 2 * 4</code>. Next type <code>x</code> followed by enter or return. You should see the value 8 print to screen. If yes, you’ve succeeded in installing R and RStudio.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you encounter any problems with the previous steps, please contact me prior to the first lab.</p>

<div id="assumption-of-risk" class="section level2">
<h2>Assumption of Risk</h2>
<p>All classes, programs, and extracurricular activities within the University involve some risk, and certain ones involve travel. The University provides opportunities to participate in these programs on a voluntary basis. Therefore, students should not participate in them if they do not care to assume the risks. Students can ask the respective program leaders/sponsors about the possible risks a program may generate, and if students are not willing to assume the risks, they should not select that program. By voluntarily participating in classes, programs, and extracurricular activities, a student does so at his or her own risk.

<h2>Withdrawal Policy and “I” Grade Policy</h2>
<p>Students are required to complete all courses for which they are registered by the end of the semester. In some cases, a student may be unable to complete all of the coursework because of extenuating circumstances, but not due to poor performance or to retain financial aid. The term ‘extenuating’ circumstances includes: (1) incapacitating illness which prevents a student from attending classes for a minimum period of two weeks, (2) a death in the immediate family, (3) financial responsibilities requiring a student to alter a work schedule to secure employment, (4) change in work schedule as required by an employer, or (5) other emergencies deemed appropriate by the instructor.</p>

<div id="emergency-procedures" class="section level2">
<h2>Emergency Procedures</h2>
<p>In the case of a drill or real emergency, classes will be notified to evacuate the building by the sound of the fire/emergency alarm system or by a building representative. In the event of a disaster that may interfere with either notification, evacuate as the situation dictates (i.e., in an earthquake when shaking ceases or immediately when a fire is discovered). Turn off computers and take any personal items with you. Elevators should not be used; instead, use the closest stairs.</p>
