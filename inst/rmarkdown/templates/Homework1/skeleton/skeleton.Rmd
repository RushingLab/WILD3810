**Due before 2:30pm Monday February 8**

In this homework assignment, you will become more familiar with using `R` and R Markdown to analyze and visualize data and report your results. To accomplish these goals, we will continue our discussion of estimating abundance using mark-recapture data.  

# Lincoln-Peterson is unbiased when sample sizes are large


```{r input}

```


```{r simulation}

```

> 1a) How many individuals do you expect to capture in $n1$? Type your answer below in bold (remember, use double asterisks before and after text to make it **bold**)

> 1b) In the chunk below, use the `mean()` function to see if the average of the randomly generated values is close to the expected value (If you need help with this function, use `?mean()` to see the help documentation).

```{r mean_n1}

```


# Lincoln-Peterson is biased when sample sizes are small


```{r LP2}


```

> 2) Based on the metrics and visualizations created by this code, do you think L-P overestimates or underestimates abundance as sample size gets smaller and smaller? Type your answer below in bold


```{r chapman}

```

> 3) According to these metrics, did bias get larger or smaller using the Chapman modifcation? Type your answer in bold

```{r chapman10}

```


> 4) If this was a real study, would you trust these estimates of $N$? Why or why not? For a population this small, what alternative methods might you use to estimate population size? Write your answers below in bold.
