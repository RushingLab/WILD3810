**Due before 2:30pm Monday February 15**

In this homework assignment, you will become more familiar with using `R` and R Markdown to analyze and visualize data and report your results. To accomplish these goals, we will continue our discussion of estimating population growth.  

# Predicting future population size

```{r setup}

```

## Estimate $\lambda$

```{r calc_lambda}

```

> 1) Over the 48 years of the Breeding Bird Survey, what was the (approximate) annual percent increase in the Utah Collared-dove population? Write you answer in bold below

## Re-calculating $\lambda$

```{r newlambda}

```

> 2) What was the (approximate) growth rate of the Utah Collared-dove population once the species arrived in Utah? Write you answer in bold below

## Predicting future population size

```{r predicted_doves, eval = FALSE}

```

> 3a) Nowhere in the above code did we write the number `21`. How does `R` know what the maximum value of the sequence should be? Write your answer in bold below

> 3b) What is the advantage of NOT just writing `21` in the code? Write your answer in bold below

> 3c) In the chunk below, write a line of `R` code that will print the predicted count in the year 2035

```{r prediction}

```

## Visualizing the predictions

```{r viz, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}

```

If you did everything correctly, you should get a graph of the predicted dove counts when you knit the document. That's a lot of doves!
