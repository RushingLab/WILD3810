In this assignment, you will build a matrix population model and then project the dynamics on the population into the future. As you go, you will be asked to answer questions about the ecology and dynamics of the population. Enter your answers in **bold** below the question.

**Be sure to include comments about what each line does in order to recieve full credit on the assignment!**

> 1a) What age or stage classes should be included in the cowbird matrix model? What are the dimensions of the model? Hint - remember that even though the first year includes multiple stages, our monitoring occurs annually so we need to project the dynamics in 1-year increments.  To do that, some of the individual stages may need to be combined into a single matrix element.

> 1b) Assuming that the population is monitored just after reproduction (after individuals lay eggs), what demographic rates will go in each matrix element? Hint - these data represent a post-breeding census. Therefore, the matrix elements in the first row need to predict the number of eggs that will be in the population in year $t + 1$ based on the number of individuals in the population in year $t$. Think about what has to happen for an individual to produce eggs *next* year.

In the chunk below, enter the code needed to create the cowbird matrix. 

```{r bhco_mat}
# Enter the data needed to create the brown-headed cowbird matrix here
```


> 2) We learned about two types of matrices that are used to model population dynamics. What type of population matrix describes the dynamics of the cowbird population? 

**Type answer here**

## Project population growth

```{r init_N}
# Enter code to generate initial stage sizes
```

Enter the code project population size here:

```{r proj_N}
# Enter code to project population size 
```

## Transient dynamics

```{r transient, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
# Enter code to create transient dynamics plot here
```

> 3) Approximately how long did your population take the reach the stable stage distribution?

**Type answer here**

### Stable stage distribution

```{r SSD, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
# Enter code to estimate the stable stage distribution here
```

> 4a) What is the stable stage distribution for this population?

**Type answer here**

> 4b) How are from the SSD was your initial population size? 

**Type answer here**


### Asymptotic $\large \lambda$

```{r lambda, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
# Insert code to estiamte and visualize lambda here
```

> 5) What is the asymptotic growth rate of this population?

**Type answer here**

### Population inertia

Now start a new population with 5000 individuals but at (or close to) the SSD. Copy the necessary code below:

```{r N_SSD, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
# Insert code to simulate a new population that starts at the SSD
```


> 6a) Did the populations grow at the same asympoptic rate? 

**Type answer here**

> 6b) Did the populations reach the same final population size? How does the difference between your random initial stage distribution and the SSD effect the population intertia?   

**Type answer here**

> 6c) What do your results tell you about the reproductive values of each stage? What do you think contributes to the differences in reproductive values among the stages?
