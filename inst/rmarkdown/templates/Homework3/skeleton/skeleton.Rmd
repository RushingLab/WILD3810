```{r include = FALSE}
# Include any code you used to complete your analysis here
# Note that because `include = FALSE` this code will not show up in your final document
# However, because R will run this code before creating the text and figures
#    this code will be available for you to include summary statistics in the text
#    and for inserting figures
```

Type your recommendations here (**delete all of the the included text after you have read it!**). Be sure to refer to the instructions provided by the writing center for help on how to format your recommendations and what information needs to be included. 

After you have a draft ready, you may schedule an appointment with the science writing center to get feedback on the draft. If you do this and document it, you will receive 4 bonus points on the assignment. 


```{r out.width="75%", echo = FALSE}
