In this homework assignment, you will become more familiar with using `R` and R Markdown to complete lab assignments.  

```{r input}

```

## Density-dependent population growth  


> 1) Which model, the logistic or Ricker, do you think is more appropriate for modeling the dynamics of Eurasian collared-doves? Explain your answer below in **bold**.  


## Eurasian collared-dove growth in the Eastern US

> 2) What might be some reasons that the dove populations in the eastern US stopped growing once they reached their carrying capacity? In other words, what factors might limit population growth at large population sizes? Provide your answer below in **bold**  



### Plotting the relationship between $r_0$, $c$, and $N$

```{r logN}


```

> 3a) Why was it necessary to filter only the counts in years > 1985? Hint: What is the value of `logN` from years 1968-1969. Write you answer in **bold** below.


> 3b) In the `for` loop, the upper limit is set to `nrow(all_dove_counts) - 1`. What is the specific numeric value of this line of code and what does it correspond to in the data? Write your answer in **bold** below.


```{r plotN}

```

> 4a) In plain English, what is the ecological interpretation of the values of $r_0$ and $c$ that you chose? Write your answer below in **bold**


> 4b) Remember from lecture 5 that we can calculate the carrying capacity $K$ from $r_0$ and $c$. Based on the values you chose for the above plot, what do you predict the carrying capacity is for collared doves in the eastern US? Write your answer below in **bold**

## Predicting density-dependent dove growth

```{r predict_DD}

```


> 5a) In approximately what year to you predict the population will reach it's carrying capacity? Hint - you can add `geom_vline(xintercept = ?)` to your graph (replace `?` with the year you think the population reaches its carrying capacity) to plot a vertical line corresponding to your answer. Write your answer below in **bold**

> 5b) The model we used to predict future abundance of collared doves is based on parameters estimated from past population growth of this species in the eastern United States. Is this a valid assumption? Why or why not? Write your answer below in **bold** (and note that there is no right or wrong answer. All models make assumptions that are, to some degree, wrong. The key question is, are they so wrong that we might come to the wrong conclusion?)
