```{r echo = FALSE}
# Include any code you used to complete your analysis here
# Note that because `echo = FALSE` this code will not show up in your final document
# However, because R will run this code before creating the text and figure
#    this code will be available for you to include summary statistics in the text
#    and for creating the figure
```
