**Due before 2:30pm Monday April 20**

In this homework assignment, you will use `R` to explore the dynamics of two competing species. 

**Important** - after completing the code, change `eval = FALSE` to `eval = TRUE` in the setup chunk options above (line 14)

Refer to the [instructions for submitting homework assignments](https://rushinglab.github.io/WILD3810/articles/homework.html) prior to submission

***


First, make sure you have:

> 1a) Changed the `author` field in the YAML header to your name;

> 1b) Clicked `Knit` to check that you can create a html document from the .Rmd file;

<<<<<<< HEAD
> 1c) Save the .Rmd file as `LastnameFirstname-homework10.Rmd`

If you have any problems with these steps, be sure to get help from either the instructor or the TA.
