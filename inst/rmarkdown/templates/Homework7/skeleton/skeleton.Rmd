Type your recommendations here (**delete all of the the included text after you have read it!**). Be sure to refer to the instructions provided by the writing center for help on how to format your recommendations and what information needs to be included. 

After you have a draft ready, you may schedule an appointment with the science writing center to get feedback on the draft. If you do this and document it, you will receive 4 bonus points on the assignment.
